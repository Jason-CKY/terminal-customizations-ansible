# Ansible playbook to setup custom terminal

This is an ansible playbook to setup both zsh plugins and oh-my-posh custom terminal theme.

The ansible playbook basically follows the 2 gists ([here](https://gist.github.com/Jason-CKY/476fcfc6970cd8553fa3b8552db5624e) and [here](https://gist.github.com/Jason-CKY/27d78f9c3fb663e9421b76026b0fbfb0)) I've written to:

* Install zsh
* Set zsh as default shell
* Install zsh plugins
* Install oh-my-posh
* Copy my custom theme
